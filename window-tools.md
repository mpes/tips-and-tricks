Short list of tools I use on Windows
# Seer
A Windows quick look tool.
Acts just like the one in macOS, but Seer is more powerful, customizable and faster.
In explorer just press `space` and preview archives, pictures, Excel tables, Word documents, text files, etc.

# [Fuzzy Finder] (https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.
Great for variety of tasks - history search (ctrl+r), git aliases, searching for a file, you name it
