Short list of tools I use on Windows
# Seer
[Seer] (http://1218.io/seer/screenshot.html) is a Windows quick look tool.
* Acts just like the one in macOS, but Seer is more powerful, customizable and faster.
* In explorer just press <kbd>space</kbd> and preview archives, pictures, Excel tables, Word documents, text files, etc.
[exe](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ccseer/files/latest/download)
# Cmder
[Cmder](http://cmder.net/) is a pre-configured software package providing you the best terminal emulator.
* Has multiple tabs, support multiple environments (Git for Bash, Bash, Mintty, PowerShell, ... ) But also others could be added (Baboon)
* Works on the top of ConEmu
* Comes with necessary UNIX tools like find, grep, ssh, git, ...
* Allows color scheme customization
# Fuzzy Finder
[Fuzzy Finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is an interactive Unix filter for command-line that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.
* Great for variety of tasks - history search (ctrl+r), git aliases, searching for a file, you name it.
